I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Infectious Disease Dynamics Group] (http://www.iddynamics.jhsph.edu) at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
My current research focuses on estimating the burden and distribution of cholera in Bangladesh based on serological biomarkers.

During my PhD, I worked with the Thailand Ministry of Public Health to [forecast dengue fever incidence](#publications) at short and long time scales.
I also developed a new causal inference technique and applied it to estimate the effect of interventions on dengue incidence (papers in progress).

Outside of the office, my interests include sports, travel, economics, voting reform, transportation issues, and video games.
Check out my full [bio](#experience) for more details!
